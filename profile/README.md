# How does Res-Q ActiFLEX work?

The main cause of joint discomfort is inflammation, which damages cartilage and leads to severe pain. Cartilage cells become distressed due to exposure to sulfur dioxide and other chemicals. For those struggling with joint pain and unable to stop the inflammation, Amish Res-Q ActiFLEX could be the ideal solution. When you start taking Res-Q ActiFLEX Capsules, it targets the root cause of inflamed joints. It forms an immune barrier to shield the joints from sulfur-related issues and reverses and repairs the damage caused. Once this harmful chemical is eliminated, joints begin to improve, allowing individuals to move and walk freely like a healthy person.
